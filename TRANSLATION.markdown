# Translating HandBrake

We use Transifex to manage the translation resources for this project.
Please see: [Transifex - HandBrake Public Page](https://www.transifex.com/HandBrakeProject/public/)

## Requirements and Rules

While we wish to welcome contributions from people, we need to have some ground rules to make sure translations run smoothly. 

- Contributors must have fluent verbal and written English. (English is the base language used for translation.)
- You must not use a translation service to aid translation. If anything is unclear, please ask!
- Our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/HandBrake/HandBrake/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and [Community Rules](https://forum.handbrake.fr/app.php/rules) must be followed.


## How to become a translator 

1. Please submit a join request on transifex for the relevant GUI that you currently use.
2. Create a "Translation Request" GitHub issue
3. We will then discuss the request and make a decision whether to accept or reject it.

## Requesting a Language

HandBrake is managed by a very small team of contributors and thus we do not have the resources to support translations for every language that may be requested.
As such, our goal is to support approximately 10 of the most requested languages.

Languages that fall out of date or lack sufficient maintainers may be removed and replaced with more popular choices if any are available.

You can request a language on the [Transifex - HandBrake Public Page](https://www.transifex.com/HandBrakeProject/public/)
